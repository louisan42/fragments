### `npm run dev`

Launches the server via `nodemon`, which watches the `src/**` folder for changes.\
The server will reload automatically when changes are made.

### `npm run debug`

This command is similar to `dev`, but also starts the `node inspector` on port `9229` so that you can attach a debugger (eg.VsCode).\

### `npm run lint`

This command runs the `eslint` linter on the project.\
